# Alien Invasion Game

### **RUNNNNN🏃🏻‍♂️!!!** Aliens👾 are invading our planet....**FEAR NOT** we will stop them using our Battle Ship🚀..
<br>

This is a Classic Retro🕹️ game that we all have played as a child or some might even be enjoying it right now.

I build this game as my first big project using **Python** and its **Pygame** Module.

It is a fun little project which helped me learn the flow of development, Code Management, Refactoring, importance of discriptive names and some other things.

I have used [**Python Crash Course By Eric Matthes $2^{nd}$ Edition**](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/) as my guide. Its is a very good book to learn python from as it focuses more on implemention rather then just the theory. It has many interesting project based chapter that are fun to do and teach us many concepts.
